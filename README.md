# Accesibility project

## Task
For this project, I was given a starter code for a website and was required to debugg and clean it up.
Several problems existed in the code such as links not working and no alt descriptions for images or symbols which limited accesibiltiy , which means it had limited functionality for someone who may have been viually impared.The CSS file was also very long and not in the same structure as the HTML.
I have tried to condense the CSS down as much as possible aswell as making the classes more semantic .
I have documented my progress via several github commits , so the entire process has been outlined.

/Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here./
