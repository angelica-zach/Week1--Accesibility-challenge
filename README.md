# Accesibility project

## Task
For this project, I was given a starter code for a website and was required to debugg and clean it up.
Several problems existed in the code such as links not working and no alt descriptions for images or symbols which limited accesibiltiy , which means it had limited functionality for someone who may have been viually impared.The CSS file was also very long and not in the same structure as the HTML.
I have tried to condense the CSS down as much as possible aswell as making the classes more semantic .
I have documented my progress via several github commits , so the entire process has been outlined.

## Installation
Press on the green code tab and pull from desired source using git clone 
## Usage 
As shown below, ![Alt text](assets/image/accesibility.png), Alt text is now visible when images are hovered over, making the site more accesibile to people who may be viually impared.
Also ![semantics](assets/image/semantic.png), the classes have been chnaged to be more semantic.
## Credits
Although i have recieved no direct help on this project i would like to credit Harkpod-4 (my group) as well as tutor Bobbi for help with ansering my questions on css.
